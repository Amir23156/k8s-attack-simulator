# k8s-attack-simulator
This project provides an attack and anomaly simulation framework for Kubernetes clusters. It enables security teams, SREs, and researchers to generate realistic events, including system failures, misconfigurations, and security attacks, to test the resilience, observability, and threat detection capabilities of cloud-native systems.
